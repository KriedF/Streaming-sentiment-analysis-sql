# Streaming Platform User Satisfaction Analysis

## 🎯 Business Problem
Streaming platforms like Roku need to understand which features drive user satisfaction and retention. This project analyzes user feedback data to identify improvement opportunities and measure the impact of product decisions.

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered
1. **Which features have the highest/lowest satisfaction rates?**
2. **How does user satisfaction vary by demographics and subscription type?**
3. **Which user segments should product teams prioritize?**
4. **What insights can guide feature development decisions?**

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- **Survey Responses**: 30 user ratings across 3 core features (voice search, recommendations, interface)
- **User Demographics**: Age groups, subscription types, regions, signup dates
- **Rating Scale**: 1-5 (1=Very Dissatisfied, 5=Very Satisfied)

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Integration**: Connecting survey responses with user demographic data
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculating satisfaction rates, averages, and NPS-style metrics
- **Business Analytics**: Translating data insights into actionable product recommendations
- **SQL Proficiency**: Advanced queries with JOINs, aggregations, and conditional logic

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Voice Search**: 60% satisfaction rate - needs improvement
- **Recommendations**: 70% satisfaction rate - performing well
- **Interface**: 80% satisfaction rate - top performer
- **Premium users show 15% higher satisfaction** across all features
- **25-34 age group most satisfied** with voice search functionality

## 🎯 Business Recommendations
1. **Investigate voice search issues** - lowest satisfaction, especially among free users
