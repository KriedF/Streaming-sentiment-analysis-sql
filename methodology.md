# Analytical Methodology

## Data Quality Approach
- **Sample Size Validation**: Only analyzed segments with minimum 3 responses for reliability
- **Data Integration**: Connected survey responses with user demographics using user_id matching
- **Rating Scale Consistency**: Used 1-5 scale with clear satisfaction thresholds (4-5 = satisfied)

## Statistical Methods
- **Satisfaction Rate**: Calculated as percentage of ratings â‰¥ 4 out of 5
- **NPS-Style Scoring**: (% promoters - % detractors) to identify feature advocacy
- **Segmentation Analysis**: Analyzed satisfaction by age group and subscription type

## Business Context Considerations
- **Feature Usage Assumption**: Analyzed all survey responses, acknowledging that connecting to actual feature usage data would strengthen analysis
- **Sample Limitations**: Small dataset used for demonstration - real analysis would require larger sample sizes for statistical significance
- **Temporal Analysis**: Single time period analyzed - longitudinal tracking would provide trend insights

## Key Analytical Decisions
1. **Minimum Sample Size**: Required 3+ responses per segment to avoid unreliable conclusions
2. **Satisfaction Threshold**: Defined satisfied users as rating 4 or 5 (industry standard)
3. **Segmentation Priority**: Focused on age and subscription type as primary business-relevant segments

## Future Enhancements
- Connect survey responses to actual feature usage logs (addressing data linkage challenges)
- Add statistical significance testing for segment differences
- Implement time-series analysis for tracking satisfaction trends
- Include text sentiment analysis of open-ended responses
